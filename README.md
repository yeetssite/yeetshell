### What is yeet shell?

yeet shell is a modification of the bourne shell(sh). Yeet shell is written in python, and can be modified by editing a single file.

yeetshell requires [python 3](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=install+python+3&t=fpas&ia=web) and might need you to run `pip install inquirerpy` first.

yeetshell is intended for Linux(or Linux-like) environments but could probably easily be ported to Windows and Mac.
